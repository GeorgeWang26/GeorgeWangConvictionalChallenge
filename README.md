# George Wang Convictional Challenge
## Assumptions
1. I assumed that the inventory value  will be indicated by the ["inventory_quantity"] key in variants (same format as required in schema for API Objects), which was missing in all variants in the raw data provided at https://my-json-server.typicode.com/convictional/engineering-interview-api/products. It was also mentioned in the schema that for each variant in the API Objects, ["inventory_quantity"] should be 0 if no information provided and ["available"] should be true if inventory > 0, false otherwise. Thus, the API enpoints have ["inventory_quantity"] = 0 and ["available"] = false for all variants and inventories for now. This will not be the case once ["inventory_quantity"] key is present in the provided raw data.
2. Another assumption I made it that most up to date data would be preferred when accessing the endpoints, so I pull data from given URL every time when API call is made. Instead of storing the data permanently once the API server is started.
